# Form_Validation_Using_Javascript
This project is a web-based user registration form that utilizes JavaScript to validate the user's input in real-time. The form validates user inputs such as username, email, phone number, password, and confirms password, ensuring that each field is filled out correctly before submission. The form also provides real-time feedback to users, indicating whether their input is valid or invalid. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it an excellent resource for web developers to learn about form validation techniques using JavaScript.



The form collects the following information from the user:

Username
1. Email
2. Phone number
3. Password
4. Confirm password
5. The program checks that each field is valid before allowing the form to be submitted. If any of the fields are invalid, an error message is displayed next to the field.
